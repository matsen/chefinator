This is some OCaml to do automated menu planning. It was one of my first OCaml projects, so it's quite rough.

It parses recipes from plain text, calculates calories of scaled recipes, and makes master shopping lists.

It was used successfully for two month-long trips rafting the Grand Canyon, first in 2008 and then in 2011.
